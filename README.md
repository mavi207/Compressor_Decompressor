# Compressor_Decompressor


**Compressor-Decompressor Application**

**Description**
This is a Java application that provides functionality for compressing and decompressing files using GZIP compression. The application comes with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to select files for compression or decompression.

**How to Use**
1. Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP archive.
2. Import the project into your Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ) or compile the Java files using the command line.
3. Run the `main` class located in the `GUI` package to launch the application.

**Usage**
1. Upon launching the application, you will see a window with two buttons: "Select Your file to Compress" and "Select Your file to Decompress."
2. Click the "Select Your file to Compress" button to choose a file you want to compress using GZIP compression. A file chooser dialog will appear, allowing you to navigate to the file you wish to compress.
3. After selecting the file, click the "Save" or "OK" button in the file chooser dialog. The application will then compress the selected file and save it as "CompressedFile.gz" in the same directory as the original file.
4. To decompress a file, click the "Select Your file to Decompress" button. Again, use the file chooser dialog to navigate to the GZIP-compressed file you want to decompress.
5. After selecting the file, click the "Save" or "OK" button in the file chooser dialog. The application will decompress the selected file and save it as "DecompressedFilecheck" in the same directory as the original compressed file.

**Requirements**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later is required to run the application.
- The application uses the GZIP compression algorithm, which is available in the standard Java library.
